# Xenium-Repacker
This simple script will take a XeniumOS image dump as input, and separate it to its individual core components.

You can then rebuild an image that can be restored via xenium-tools.

It is not recommended to change the recovery image, ever. Like, ever. We have no warranty and will not be held liable for any damages caused to you, your console, or in the random event you cat spontaneously combusts (Sorry Steve.)
